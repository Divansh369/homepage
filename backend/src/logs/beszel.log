WARN You are using modernc.org/libc v1.64.0 which differs from the expected and tested v1.62.1.
Please update your go.mod and manually set modernc.org/libc to v1.62.1, otherwise it could result in unexpected build or runtime errors (you may have to also run 'go clean -modcache' to clear the cache if the warning persists).
